# 10 Linux Command every Software Engineer should know
=========================================================


1) top / htop - Monitor system performance in Real-Time, including CPU, memory, and active processes, in real-time & "htop" is just a Wrapper on top of "top" Command and it Provides Better Readability.



2) ps / pgrep / pstree -p - View running processes, find process IDs, and visualize parent-child relationships, Hierarchy of All the Processes.





3) netstat / netstat -tunlp / ss - Inspect network connections, listening ports, and interface statistics.


-------------

netstat – Displays network status (connections, routing tables, interfaces, etc.)

-t – Show TCP connections
-u – Show UDP connections
-n – Show numerical addresses (IP addresses and port numbers instead of resolving names)
-l – Show listening sockets (services waiting for connections)
-p – Show the PID and program name using the socket

Note - Requires root privileges (sudo) to see all processes

------------






4) tcpdump - Capture and analyze network packets to diagnose connectivity issues.


------------

sudo tcpdump -i ens5 port 80  [ens5 is the Network Interface we can run "ifconfig" Command and check the Interface name]

Below is the Breakdown of the Command


- sudo
Required because packet capture needs root privileges.

- tcpdump
A command-line packet analyzer used to inspect network traffic.

- -i ens5
Specifies the network interface to listen on (e.g., Ethernet or Wi-Fi adapter).
Replace enX0 with your actual interface name (like eth0, ens33, wlan0).

- port 80
A BPF filter that captures only packets where source or destination port is 80 (HTTP).

------------






5) ping / traceroute / mtr - Test network connectivity and trace the path to a remote host.





6) df / du - Check disk space usage and find large directories or files. [By using du -sh /opt we will get the Size of the /opt Directory]






7) free / vmstat - Monitor memory usage and view virtual memory statistics.





8) journalctl - Access system Logs managed by systemd to Troubleshoot Service Issues.


------------

journalctl -u nginx

------------






9) lsof - Identify open files and the processes that opened them.   ["netstat -tunlp"  then select the Port u want to checki and run this Command "lsof -i :8085"]






10) tail / less / grep - Inspect and filter log files to find errors or specific patterns.



[sudo head -n 10 /var/log/auth.log] - To List the First 10 Lines


[sudo tail -n 10 /var/log/auth.log] - To List the Last 10 Lines
